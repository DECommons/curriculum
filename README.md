Welcome to the open-source curriculum for **The Data Engineering Commons**. This repository serves as the "textbook" for our learning path.

## 📖 What is this?
This is a structured learning path designed to take you from the basics of computer science and database theory to complex distributed systems and modern data orchestration.

Unlike scattered blog posts, this curriculum is designed to be read:
1.  **Linearly:** For those starting their journey.
2.  **Referentially:** For professionals needing a refresher on specific topics.

## 🔗 Relationship to "The Labs"
Theory is useless without practice. This repository works in tandem with **[The Labs](https://github.com/DECommons/labs)**.
* **Here:** You learn *why* we use a tool and *how* it fits into the architecture.
* **There:** You spin up the container and write the code.

## 🚀 Roadmap
* [ ] Module 1: Foundations of Data
* [ ] Module 2: The ETL/ELT Paradigm
* [ ] Module 3: Batch vs. Stream
* [ ] Module 4: Orchestration & Modeling
