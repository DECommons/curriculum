# Welcome to the Open Data Engineering Academy
There is a joke in our industry that a Data Engineer is just a Software Engineer who loves suffering.

If you look at the landscape today (the "Modern Data Stack" with its thousands of logos, the endless debates about batch versus streaming, and the fragile pipelines that break at 3:00 AM because a CSV file had an extra comma), it is easy to see why people think that. It is loud, it is chaotic, and it is overwhelmingly complex.

But there is beauty in the chaos. There is a deep satisfaction in taking the raw, messy exhaust of the digital world and refining it into something structured, reliable, and truthful.

This Academy is my attempt to map that chaos.

## What is this place?
This is a comprehensive, open-source curriculum designed to take you from "I know a little Python" to "I can architect a scalable data platform."

**It is completely free**. It will always be free. Knowledge shouldn't have a subscription fee, and the barrier to entry for this career shouldn't be a $5,000 bootcamp.

However, "free" does not mean "easy." This is not a collection of copy-paste tutorials. We are not going to just memorize syntax; we are going to build things. We are going to break things. And then we are going to debug them until we understand *why* they broke. 

## How it works
I have structured this journey into distinct phases/modules. You can see them in the navigation bar above. Your goal should be to move through them from left-to-right, covering each sub-module from top-to-bottom. That is, unless your already a seasoned pro in some aspect; then you can feel free to move on to the next topic. I have structured the content in this website to be useful for those with no prior knowledge, to those that design pipelines already for a living.

## Companion Labs
All the applicable sub-modules in this website have companion labs. To do the labs, and to keep the website free, the labs are designed in Docker environments to be cloned and ran within your own computing environment. When a lab is available on the topic, it will be discussed in that topics introductory section. 

## Quizzes
Not every topic will have labs. However, every topic has quizzes, that are designed to gauge your understanding of what "I" feel is the most important aspects of the lesson. This is to ensure that all topics can be evaluated by you, before moving on to the next topic.

## Prerequisites
I assume you have a computer, an internet connection, and a tolerance for frustration.

I do not assume you have a Computer Science degree. If you are willing to read the error message and Google it, you have everything you need to succeed here (and as an Engineer, for that matter).

## A Note on Tools
We will use specific tools in the courses (like Postgres, DuckDB, AIrflow, etc.). But please remember: **The tools are not the point**. The tools will change. In 5 years, we might **all** be using something completely new.

The concepts, those remain. Focus on the concepts.
